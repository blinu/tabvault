# tabvault

tabvault extracts, organises, and preserves unsaved Notepad++ tabs into a structured, searchable local knowledge base.

## Features

- Extracts unsaved Notepad++ tabs safely
- Never modifies original files
- Automatically classifies snippets
- Organises into structured folders
- Fully local and private

## Why?

Notepad++ allows hundreds of unsaved tabs. tabvault converts them into structured files so they are never lost again.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/run_tabvault.py
